Go to the URL https://github.com/R0yKaustav/NLP_Chatbot_Final/tree/main and download the below files in order:

1. xcldata.csv
2. csvtojson.py
3. projectdata.json
4. SEP740Project_Final.ipynb

Save the above files in a folder on your desktop.

Steps to run the Code:

1. When you open the code in github, you will see an option called "Open in Colab"
2. Click the above option and you will be directed to the colab page
3. Next, you need to upload the json file (projectdata.json) saved in the folder in your system
4. Once uploading is done, run all the steps to reach the last step where you will be interacting with the chatbot
5. Pass the questions (patterns) as inputs and see the answers (responses) as given in the projectdata.json.

Note: The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/QA-data/?ref=hackernoon.com

Suggestion: Since the data have been cleaned and only as subset of the data has been chosen for the project, it is suggested to use "xcldata.csv" and "projectdata.json" for the first run.
